# SoftTrust-Concept
Contains the scripts of SoftTrust, a software trust assessment tool based on the analysis of messages under GitHub repositories.

This concept is presented and motivated in the research entitled: 
 "Sentiment Analysis and Software Trust: the Creation and the Exploration of a DataSet" 
by Hidde Reeskamp, Slinger Jansen, Marijn Schraagen (2022).

The repository contains the files involved in the design of the work's artefact SoftTrust.

The directory 'SoftTrust' contains the scripts used for each of the component of SoftTrust. 
Not all components found in the work have scripts yet, as the design is still a concept.
